🚀 Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLO

A real-time object detection system built using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning algorithm. This project detects and classifies multiple objects in images, videos, or live webcam streams with high speed and accuracy.

📌 Project Overview

Object detection is a key task in computer vision that identifies and localizes objects within an image or video frame. YOLO treats detection as a single regression problem, making it extremely fast and suitable for real-time applications.
